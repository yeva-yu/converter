If you are found guilty of exceeding the legal limit of alcohol, you likely have to pay a minimum penalty of a $1,000 fine and a one year licence suspension if it is your first offence. \n For a second offence, you will usually be subject to a minimum penalty of 30 days in prison, and a minimum three year licence suspension. \n For a third offence, you will have a minimum penalty of 120 days in prison and a lengthy licence suspension.",[alcohol | driving under the influence | BAC | breath | breathalizer
